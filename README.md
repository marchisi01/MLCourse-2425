# MLCourse-2425
Material for the course "Big Data Science and Machine Learning" of the academic year 2024-2025 for the Graduate Program in Physics of the 
University of Turin, held on Nov 24th-28th, 2025. 

## Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of python 

## Before the course starts

- We will be using python, in particular I advise you to get familiar with Jupyter notebooks, numpy and pandas before the course starts. No expert knowledge is required, but doing a couple of tutorials on these topics (easily found on the web) is highly recommended.
- We will use github for authentication on JupyterHub. 
  - Please send us your github account. 
  - The username should not contain any special character, such as -, _, ., etc. 
  - If it does, please create a new account that fulfills the requirements.

## Practicalities

- The course will be held on site, and it will not be possible to attend remotely. To pass the course you need to follow 80% of the lessons and pass the final test.
- Every day we will have a mixture of theoretical and hands-on sessions. The last day we will have only hands-on with exercises, which will also be the test for those who needs to get CFU credits.

## Schedule:

- The lectures will take place on Nov 24th-28th in Aula Castagnoli from 14:00 to 16:00.
- The exam can be turned in up to Jan. 6th
